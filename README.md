# walk-now-app

Repository for the walk:now project for the hack:now hackathon, April 24-26, 2020.

Hackers: Linda Deng, Rachel Li, Megan Zhu

We created an iOS app called walk:now. With the COVID-19 situation, many of us are incapable of going outside and enjoying a walk like we normally would. We created this app to simulate that process. The app reads in the number of steps you have taken today in real life from your Apple Health app, and allows you to take the corresponding number of steps in Google Street View mode. 

We worked with the Google Maps API (Maps SDK for iOS) as well as Apple Healthkit. We created a [mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/xBiTjGFFJ2g5M6BwepKj9d/walk%3Anow?node-id=1%3A2) on Figma.
